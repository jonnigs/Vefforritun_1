    <h1> The War of the Worlds</h1>
    <h2> by H. G. Wells (1898)</h2>

    <blockquote>
      "
        But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be inhabited? …Are we or they Lords of the World? … And how are all things made for man?--
        "

    <h3>Chapter one: The Eve of the War</h3>

    <p>
      No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth
      century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by
      intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as
      men busied themselves about their various concerns they were
      scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a
      microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and
      multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to
      and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their
      assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the
      infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to
      the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of
      them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or
      improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of
      those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be
      other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to
      welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds
      that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,
      intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with
      envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And
      early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.

      The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the
      sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it
      receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.
      It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our
      world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its
      surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one
      seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling
      to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water
      and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,
      up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that
      intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,
      beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since
      Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the
      superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that
      it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.
