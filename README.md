# Vefforritun 1

Projects that I made in the course Vefforritun 1 (Web programing 1)

### Stórt verkefni 2

Final project in Vefforritun 1 (Web programing 1). This project uses most of the features I learned throughout the semester. The main page reads from a json file and displays the data accordingly using JavaScript. The second page reads the params from the URL and displays the correct video. The look of the page is written with Sass and node.js was used in various ways throughout the project, such as es-lint, stylelint ans browser-sync.

### Verkefni 10

Fourth JavaScript project. A countdown that is saved in local storage. If local storage is empty then the user can make a new counter. He can enter a name for the counter, a date and time. If there is something in the local storage then the coundown is displayed and updates live. Since the countdown is saved in local storage the page can be refreshed or exited without losing the countdown.
